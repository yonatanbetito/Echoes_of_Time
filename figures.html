    <h1>The People of Atlantis</h1>

    <p>
      The myth of Atlantis introduces us to a number of intriguing figures, both
      divine and mortal. Central to the story is Poseidon, the god of the sea,
      earthquakes, and horses. According to <strong>Plato</strong>, Poseidon
      discovered a beautiful mortal woman named Cleito and fell deeply in love
      with her. To protect her, he created the island of Atlantis, surrounding
      it with rings of land and sea.

      Poseidon and Cleito had ten sonsâ€”five pairs of male twins. The eldest,
      <strong>Atlas</strong>, was given control over the entire island and
      became the first king. His name later became synonymous with Atlantis, and
      the Atlantic Ocean itself was named after him. Each of the ten sons ruled
      a portion of the island and established a dynasty of kings.

      The Atlanteans were described as noble, wise, and spiritually inclined.
      They lived in harmony with nature and followed the divine laws set by
      <strong>Poseidon</strong>. The kings of Atlantis met in a central temple,
      where they ruled with justice and balance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over generations, however, these values declined. The kings became
      obsessed with luxury and power. Their rule became unjust and oppressive.
      Eventually, their pride led to their downfall, as the gods decided to
      destroy Atlantis.
