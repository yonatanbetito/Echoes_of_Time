    <h1>Artifacts of Atlantis</h1>

    <p>
      Although Atlantis has never been found, the idea that it once existed has
      inspired thousands of theories and searches. Many believe that the lost
      city left behind ruins, artifacts, and traces of its greatness beneath the
      ocean. These legendary remnants have become part of both popular
      imagination and pseudoarchaeology.

      One of the most talked-about objects is the mythical metal called
      <strong>orichalcum</strong>, which
      <a href="figures.html#plato">Plato</a> described as a rare and precious
      material that shined like fire. According to his writings, it was second
      in value only to gold and was used to decorate temples, walls, and
      pillars. In 2015, metal ingots believed to be orichalcum were found in a
      shipwreck off the coast of Sicily, although the material turned out to be
      a mix of copper and zinc.

      Another recurring element in Atlantis legends is the use of
      <strong>crystals</strong>. Some believe Atlanteans used giant energy
      crystals to power their civilization, much like electricity. These ideas
      are found mostly in New Age beliefs and fictional works, but they continue
      to fascinate people.

    <p>
      Around the world, underwater structures such as the
      <strong>Yonaguni Monument</strong> in Japan and the
      <strong>Caribbean ruins</strong> off Cuba have been linked—often
      controversially—to Atlantis. These formations are sometimes geometric and
      appear to be man-made, but most scientists attribute them to natural
      geological processes.

    <ul>
      <li>Advanced technology powered by crystals</li>
      <li>Golden statues and temple ruins</li>
      <li>Submerged cities detected by sonar</li>

    <p>
      While no proven artifacts from Atlantis have been found, the search
      continues. These imagined relics keep the story of Atlantis alive and
      connect people with the possibility that our past may hold lost wonders.
