    The story of Atlantis begins with the Greek philosopher <a href="figures.html#plato">Plato</a>, who introduced the legend in his dialogues "Timaeus" and "Critias," written around 360 BCE. According to <a href="figures.html#plato">Plato</a>, Atlantis was a powerful island nation located beyond the "Pillars of Hercules," a phrase often interpreted as the Strait of Gibraltar. He described the island as larger than Libya and Asia combined, full of natural resources, and home to an advanced civilization.

    Atlantis was said to have been founded by the god <a href="figures.html#Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, who fell in love with a mortal woman named Cleito. To protect her, he created a series of concentric rings of land and water and placed her at the center. <a href="figures.html#Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and Cleito had five pairs of twins, and the eldest son, Atlas, became king of the island. The name "Atlantis" is derived from him.

    The Atlantean civilization grew rapidly. Their architecture, political systems, and naval power were unmatched. Their capital was a marvel of engineering, featuring canals, bridges, aqueducts, and palaces adorned with gold, silver, and ivory. Atlantis was a utopiaâ€”at least for a time.

    However, over time, the Atlanteans grew greedy, prideful, and corrupt. Their desire for expansion and power led to a war against Athens and other parts of the world. The gods, angered by their arrogance, punished them. In a single day and night of catastrophe, earthquakes and floods destroyed Atlantis, sinking it into the ocean.
  </p>

  <p>
    Scholars still debate whether <a href="figures.html#plato">Plato</a> meant the story as a historical account or a moral allegory. Regardless of its origins, Atlantis remains a symbol of human ambition, greatness, and the dangers of hubris. Its mystery continues to captivate imaginations around the world.
